## My process

I started developing the mobile part, then I just adjusted it to desktop using media query, I realized that I could deal
with images in two ways, using two different images in HTML with the `picture` tag or in CSS as background, I chose
the second option.

The same can be said of the shopping cart image inside the button, I put it with CSS, using
the `before` pseudo-element.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5
